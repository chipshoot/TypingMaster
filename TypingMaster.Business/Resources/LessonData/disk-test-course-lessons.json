The vizier spoke to her, \"Your excellency, it is because your mind is constantly occupied with your many exquisite possessions.  When your mind is absorbed with thoughts of jewels, palaces, and gold it cannot find equilibrium.\"  The queen pondered the vizier's words, and realized that he had spoken the truth.  She decided to renounce her wealth and go live in the forest.  She passed many years of simple living but still did not find inner peace.  One day as she was gathering firewood she met the vizier on the road and told him of her plight.  \", \"My lady, \" he said, \", \"even though you live simply, your mind still hankers for your lost wealth.  Your mind is even more absorbed with riches than before, and so you have not found peace.",

He paused, twitching his nose, catching the faint scent of walnuts hidden somewhere nearby. Suddenly, a flash of blue caught his eye – a jay feather! He grabbed the prize, examining its vibrant color. Just then, a large, lazy cat yawned nearby. Zipping up the nearest oak tree, feather safely tucked away, Zippy decided the walnuts could wait for a less hazardous moment. Safety first!",

Inside, the only sounds were the quiet rustle of turning pages and the occasional soft click of a keyboard. Rows upon rows of books stood silent, holding endless knowledge and amazing adventures. Maya found her favorite cozy armchair in a quiet corner, opened her chosen novel, and quickly became lost in a world of dragons and magic. Libraries offered such a peaceful escape from the often noisy, complex outside world.",
